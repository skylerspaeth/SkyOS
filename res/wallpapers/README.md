These wallpapers seem to be traced back to a forum post on Polycount in 2014 when user Logithx was showing his latest work. It is built in Unreal Engine 3. The original images and backstory can be found here: https://polycount.com/discussion/comment/2037585#Comment_2037585

## Mars Launchpad
```

```
This picture is thought to depict a shuttle on a crawler preparing for its flight to Mars. I initially stumbled upon this wallpaper via Reddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/fgubc7/launchpad_by_wanbao_3840x2160/
As far as I can tell though, the original was posted by uesr wanbao on DeviantArt here: https://www.deviantart.com/wanbao/art/071-1-699447515
