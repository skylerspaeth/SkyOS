# SkyOS
SkyOS is a Fedora post-install script to build a familiar, Windows-like desktop on Linux.

The latest release, SkyOS Hibiscus, is designed to be used on a brand new Fedora 36 system, though will likely work fine on one already setup.

## Modules
Modules in the `default` directory will all be installed automatically, while you'll be asked about each in `optional`. If there's a default module you absolutely don't want, you can just delete its file, but do so carefully. You may break another module's dependency.
